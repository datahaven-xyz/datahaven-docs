# Data Storage Quickstart

DataHaven is a fully EVM-compatible decentralized storage and computation platform built as a sovereign Substrate-based Layer 1 chain. It combines Ethereum-style accounts and tooling with Substrateâ€™s modular runtime to provide seamless interaction between on-chain smart contracts and off-chain data storage. Developers can interact with DataHaven using familiar Ethereum RPCs, wallets, and libraries such as MetaMask or viem, while also accessing Substrate APIs for advanced features like governance or custom runtime calls.

By integrating with EigenLayer, DataHaven operates as an Autonomous Verifiable Service (AVS) secured by Ethereum restakers, inheriting Ethereum's security without relying on its own validator bootstrap. This unified design enables decentralized applications to coordinate computation and storage through a single network that links smart contract logic with verifiable, persistent data maintained by storage providers.

## DataHaven Networks

To start building on DataHaven, check out the list of currently available DataHaven networks:

|      Network      | Network Type | Native Asset Symbol | Native Asset Decimals |
|:-----------------:|:------------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|
| DataHaven TestNet |   TestNet    |        HAVE         |          18           |

### Network Configurations

To interact with the network, use the following information to configure DataHaven within the developer tools you are using:

=== "DataHaven TestNet"

|    Variable     |                    Value                     |
|:---------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
|    Chain ID     | <pre>`{{ networks.testnet.chain_id }}`</pre> |
| Public RPC URLs | <pre>`{{ networks.testnet.rpc_url }}`</pre>  |
| Public WSS URLs | <pre>`{{ networks.testnet.wss_url }}`</pre>  |

### Block Explorers

DataHaven provides dedicated explorers for both its EVM and Substrate layers:

|           Explorer           |   Layer   |
|:----------------------------:|:---------:|
| [TODO](TODO){target=\_blank} | Ethereum  |
| [TODO](TODO){target=\_blank} | Substrate |

## Funding TestNet Accounts

To begin building on a DataHaven test network, you'll need to obtain HAVE tokens to cover transaction fees and interact with the network. These tokens are distributed freely for testing and development purposes only.

|      TestNet      |            Where To Get Tokens From             | Amount Dispensed                                                                 |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DataHaven TestNet | [Official TestNet Faucet](TODO){target=\_blank} | The faucet dispenses {{ networks.testnet.website_faucet_amount }} every 24 hours |

!!! note
    TestNet HAVE tokens do not have any market value. Please do not spam the faucet with unnecessary requests.

## MSP Service Endpoints

To interact with a Main Storage Provider (MSP) through `@storagehub-sdk/msp-client`, a service endpoint is required. You can use any of the following MSP base URLs as an endpoint for storing and retrieving your files:

|      Network      |                                 Value                                 |
|:-----------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|
