# Data Storage Starter Kit

DataHaven is fully EVM-compatible. You can use familiar Ethereum RPCs, wallets, and libraries such as MetaMask or viem, to interact with the platform while also accessing Substrate APIs for additional features.

## DataHaven Networks

To start building on DataHaven, check out the list of currently available DataHaven networks:

|      Network      | Network Type | Native Asset Symbol | Native Asset Decimals |
|:-----------------:|:------------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|
| DataHaven TestNet |   TestNet    |        HAVE         |          18           |

### Network Configurations

To interact with the network, use the following information to configure DataHaven within the developer tools you are using:

=== "DataHaven TestNet"

    |    Variable     |                    Value                     |
    |:---------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
    |    Chain ID     | <pre>`{{ networks.testnet.chain_id }}`</pre> |
    | Public RPC URLs | <pre>`{{ networks.testnet.rpc_url }}`</pre>  |
    | Public WSS URLs | <pre>`{{ networks.testnet.wss_url }}`</pre>  |

### Block Explorers

DataHaven provides dedicated explorers for both its EVM and Substrate layers:

|           Explorer           |   Layer   |
|:----------------------------:|:---------:|
| [TODO](TODO){target=\_blank} | Ethereum  |
| [TODO](TODO){target=\_blank} | Substrate |

## Funding TestNet Accounts

To begin building on a DataHaven test network, you'll need to obtain HAVE tokens to cover transaction fees and interact with the network. These tokens are distributed freely for testing and development purposes only.

|      TestNet      |            Where To Get Tokens From             | Amount Dispensed                                                                 |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DataHaven TestNet | [Official TestNet Faucet](TODO){target=\_blank} | The faucet dispenses {{ networks.testnet.website_faucet_amount }} every 24 hours |

TestNet HAVE tokens do not have any market value. Please do not spam the faucet with unnecessary requests.

## MSP Service Endpoints

To interact with a Main Storage Provider (MSP) through `@storagehub-sdk/msp-client`, a service endpoint is required. You can use any of the following MSP base URLs as an endpoint for storing and retrieving your files:

|      Network      |                                 Value                                 |
|:-----------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| DataHaven TestNet | <pre>`https://deo-dh-backend.stagenet.datahaven-infra.network/`</pre> |
