# Store and Retrieve Data Overview

DataHaven is a verifiable storage network that separates storage from verification. Storage providers hold your file bytes off-chain, while the chain records compact on-chain commitments. These commitments serve as "receipts" so data can be checked at read time.

This section provides a high-level overview of how to create a bucket, upload files, and retrieve them.

## How File Storage Works at a Glance

1. **Pick an MSP and bucket**: Connect your wallet, select a Main Storage Provider (MSP), and create a bucket. Set your desired replication factor for backup copies.

2. **Upload data**: Send a storage request to the MSP, which stores your file and coordinates replication to Backup Storage Providers (BSPs). Once enough BSPs confirm storage, the MSP records a cryptographic commitment on-chain, securing your file on the network.

3. **Retrieve data**: The MSP returns your file with a proof that you can verify against the on-chain commitment, confirming your data matches what was stored.

    MSP->>Blockchain: Anchor cryptographic commitment

    User->>Blockchain: Verify proof
```

DataHaven provides the benefits of provable data without the high cost of storing entire data files on-chain.
