# Update Bucket Privacy

!!! note "SDK support not yet available"
    The `updateBucketPrivacy` operation is not currently available through the StorageHub SDK. To update a bucket's privacy setting, switch to the **SC** tab at the top of this page to follow the smart contract guide, which calls the FileSystem Precompile directly.
