# Resolve Insolvent Status via UI

If your account balance runs out while you have active payment streams, the DataHaven network will flag your account as insolvent. This guide covers the process of checking your insolvent status, paying off any outstanding debt, and clearing the insolvent flag to restore your account's ability to store files in the network. This guide will cover the UI approach through the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=\_blank} UI, while the [Resolve Insolvent Status via API](/store-and-retrieve-data/use-storagehub-sdk/resolve-insolvent-status-via-api.md) guide covers the Polkadot API approach.
