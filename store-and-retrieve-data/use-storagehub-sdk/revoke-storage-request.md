# Revoke a Storage Request

!!! note "SDK support not yet available"
    The `revokeStorageRequest` operation is not currently available through the StorageHub SDK. To revoke a pending storage request, switch to the **SC** tab at the top of this page to follow the smart contract guide, which calls the FileSystem Precompile directly.
