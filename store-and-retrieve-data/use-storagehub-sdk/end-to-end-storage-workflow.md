## Introduction

This guide walks you through the exact order of operations for storing a file on DataHaven and retrieving it back. Follow each step in sequence; each guide linked below provides the detailed code you will run.

## Workflow at a Glance

For more details on each step, check out the respective guides for each one.

## Step-by-Step

### Prerequisite: Create a Bucket

This tutorial assumes you've already created a bucket and know its bucket name to be able to access it. If you haven't yet created a bucket, you can do by following the [Create a Bucket Guide](/store-and-retrieve-data/use-storagehub-sdk/create-a-bucket).

### 1) Issue a Storage Request

Register your intent to store a file in your bucket and set its replication policy. Initialize `FileManager`, compute the fileâ€™s fingerprint, fetch MSP info (and extract peer IDs), choose a replication level and replica count, then call issueStorageRequest

```ts title="Issue a Storage Request"
--8<-- 'code/store-and-retrieve-data/use-storagehub-sdk/issue-a-storage-request/combined.ts'
```

### 2) Verify if Storage Request is On-Chain

Derive the deterministic file key, query on-chain state, and confirm the request exists and matches your local fingerprint and bucket.

```ts title="Verify if Storage Request is On-Chain"
--8<-- 'code/store-and-retrieve-data/use-storagehub-sdk/verify-if-storage-request-is-on-chain/combined.ts'
```

### 3) Authenticate with SIWE and JWT

Sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE) to the MSP and obtain a short-lived JWT to authorize upload and retrieval operations.

```ts title="Authenticate with SIWE and JWT"
--8<-- 'code/store-and-retrieve-data/use-storagehub-sdk/authenticate-with-siwe-and-jwt/combined.ts'
```

### 4) Upload Your First File

Send the file bytes to the MSP, linked to your Storage Request. Confirm the upload receipt indicates a successful upload.

```ts title="Upload Your First File"
--8<-- 'code/store-and-retrieve-data/use-storagehub-sdk/upload-your-first-file/combined.ts'
```

### 5) Retrieve Your Data

Download the file by its deterministic key from the MSP and save it locally.

```ts title="Retrieve Your Data"
--8<-- 'code/store-and-retrieve-data/use-storagehub-sdk/retrieve-your-data/combined.ts'
```

## Putting it All Together

The code containing the complete series of steps from issuing a storage request to retrieving the data can be accessed below.

    ```

### Notes on Data Safety

Uploading a file does not guarantee network-wide replication. Files are considered secured by DataHaven only after replication to a Backup Storage Provider (BSP) completes. Tooling to surface replication status is in active development.
