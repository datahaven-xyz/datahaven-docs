# Tokenomics

!!! warning 
    The HAVE token has not yet launched. No official token contracts currently exist. Avoid interacting with any token claiming to be HAVE. For updates, always refer to DataHaven’s official channels.

HAVE is DataHaven's native token and is used to pay fees related to storage operations. The following sections explore key tokenomic concepts, including token utility, supply, fees, and bridging.

## Stake to Secure DataHaven

DataHaven security is anchored by Ethereum re-staking via [EigenLayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz){target=\_blank}; however, other assets may also be staked or restaked to help secure the AVS. HAVE holders can delegate their stake to operators to help secure the network and earn rewards. 

[Moonbeam's](https://moonbeam.network){target="\_blank"} native token GLMR and GLMR LSTs will also be supported for restaking. See [GLMR re-staking](#glmr-re-staking) below.

## Pay Gas Fees 

HAVE is the network’s native gas token used to pay for computation and transaction fees. A dynamic fee mechanism will mitigate spam and promote efficient resource use. Priority fees accrue to operators, while base fee handling (burn vs treasury split) is governed on-chain.

## Pay Storage Fees and Incentives

DataHaven storage fees may be paid in HAVE, and storage providers may be compensated in HAVE. The goal is predictable, fiat-referenced pricing per GB per unit time. Storage providers must post collateral in HAVE; backup storage providers can be slashed for data loss, reinforcing durability commitments.

## Participate in Governance

HAVE is central to governance. Token holders may propose and vote on protocol changes, fee parameters, council composition, and treasury allocations via transparent, on-chain processes. Delegation is supported for holders who prefer to participate through a representative.

## Restake GLMR

As DataHaven expands from the Moonbeam ecosystem, GLMR holders remain integral. In partnership with [StellaSwap](https://stellaswap.com/){target=\_blank}, GLMR holders will be able to re-stake and earn both Moonbeam-native staking rewards and additional emissions for helping secure DataHaven.

## Bridge HAVE Tokens

The native token will be bridgeable using standardized cross-chain infrastructure, with options such as Snowbridge for message passing where applicable. Additional details will be provided closer to launch.

## Token Supply and Distribution

The HAVE token genesis supply is 10 billion tokens issued on the DataHaven network. For for a detailed look at allocation, vesting, and inflation information, visit the [Tokenomics](https://datahaven.xyz/tokenomics/){target=\_blank} section of the DataHaven website.
