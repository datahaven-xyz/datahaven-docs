# Snowbridge and Cross-Chain Messaging

While DataHaven is a sovereign Layer 1 blockchain, it isn't meant to operate in isolation. It's built to communicate with Ethereum and other ecosystems. This is where Snowbridge comes in.

## What is Snowbridge?

[Snowbridge](https://app.snowbridge.network/){target=_blank} is a decentralized, trustless bridge protocol connecting Ethereum and Substrate-based chains (such as DataHaven). It allows the secure transfer of assets and arbitrary messages between these networks using on-chain light clients. This means each side can verify the other’s state directly, without relying on third-party custodians or multisigs.

In practice, Snowbridge provides DataHaven with a native bridge to Ethereum, enabling bi-directional communication and interoperability. It serves as the backbone for both token transfers (e.g., wrapped ETH or ERC-20 assets) and message passing (e.g., validator updates or reward synchronization for the EigenLayer AVS).

## Why Cross-Chain Messaging Matters

DataHaven is designed to operate within a broader, interoperable Web3 ecosystem. Through Snowbridge, it can:

- **Inherit security from Ethereum**: Messages from EigenLayer’s contracts (e.g., validator sets, slashing events) are relayed to DataHaven in a verifiable way.
- **Send state updates back to Ethereum**: DataHaven reports block finality, validator rewards, and other on-chain data back to EigenLayer contracts.
- **Enable multi-chain dApps**: Developers can build applications that combine Ethereum smart contracts and DataHaven’s decentralized storage in one workflow (e.g., mint an NFT on Ethereum while storing its underlying data on DataHaven).

## How It Works at a Glance

- **Trustless verification**: Messages are verified by on-chain light clients using cryptographic proofs with no trusted intermediaries.
- **Bi-directional by design**: DataHaven can receive messages from Ethereum (e.g., AVS updates) and can send messages back when required.
- **Relayer-incentivized delivery**: Senders attach fees to cover execution and relaying; relayers are compensated upon successful delivery.
- **Operator address mapping**: Validators publish their DataHaven address so AVS-related messages (like validator lists) reference the correct accounts on-chain.

## How DataHaven Uses Snowbridge

- **AVS coordination**: Propagating validator-set updates between Ethereum (EigenLayer) and DataHaven, so both networks share a consistent view.
- **Interoperable UX**: Enabling future flows like reporting state back to Ethereum or bridging app-specific messages without custom trust assumptions.
